*Selected review*: "Ben was incredibly patient during office hours and always responsive to
student questions. In addition, he often presented demos during office hours or showed easier ways
to handle the homework assignments; both were very helpful."
<!-- - Read more reviews at [benjamindkilleen.com/teaching/reviews](https://benjamindkilleen.com/teaching/reviews) -->

<!-- "Benjamin is very knowledgeable and is good at explaining concepts. He was friendly, professional, respectful and mature. He made himself available, showed up consistently on time, and prepared helpful and easy-to-follow mini-lectures for the lab sessions. He was the TA I felt most comfortable working with and the one I learned the most from." -->
